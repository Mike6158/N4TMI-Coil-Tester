# N4TMI-Coil-Tester
N4TMI Coil Test Oscillator
This circut was originally published in 73 magazine by N4TMI. 
It has since been republished at: https://www.radio-collector.com/coil-resonance-tester/
W2AEW's YouTube Channel has a nice video about how to determine the value of the device under test.
You can find it here: https://youtu.be/Ff5xOENID7w
I've built the circuit, modified to W2AEW's version, and it works. The board file is on Osh Park and 
can be found here: <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/gx7Ixj44"><img src="https://oshpark.com/assets/badge-5b7ec47045b78aef6eb9d83b3bac6b1920de805e9a0c227658eac6e19a045b9c.png" alt="Order from OSH Park"></img></a>
Or you can use or modify the included Eagle files as you wish
