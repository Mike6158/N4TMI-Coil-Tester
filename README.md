# N4TMI-Coil-Tester
N4TMI Coil Test Oscillator
This circut was originally published in 73 magazine by N4TMI. 
It has since been republished at: https://www.radio-collector.com/coil-resonance-tester/
W2AEW's YouTube Channel has a nice video about how to determine the value of the device under test.

I've built the circuit, modified to W2AEW's version, and it works. The board file is on Osh Park and 
can be found here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/gx7Ixj44
Or you can use or modify the included Eagle files as you wish
